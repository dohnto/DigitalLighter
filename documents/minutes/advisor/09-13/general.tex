We started the meeting with revising what we have done last week, we tried to demonstrate the working prototype, but we came across technical issues so after all we demonstrated the prototype using youtube video. We discussed the contents of project report and supervisor suggested to describe the architecture and design patterns we used. Supervisor suggested that we should use time estimation and time tracking.
