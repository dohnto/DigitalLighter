In this chapter, product architecture is described using 4 + 1 architectural view model.
It is based on the multiple concurrent views and therefore better explanation of architecture can be provided.

\section{4 + 1 architectural view model}
\subsection{Logical view}
The description of the functional requirements of the architecture. The client and the server are decomposed into a set of key abstractions, taken(mostly) from the problem domain, in the form of objects or object classes.

\subsection{Development view}
\subsection{Process view}
\subsection{Physical view}
\subsection{Scenarios}
Use case diagrams can be considered as scenarios, therefore introduced diagram \ref{img:usecase} in Requirements chapter can be considered as a scenario.

\section{Used design patterns}
\subsection{Strategy}
\subsection{Model-View-Controller}
\subsection{Observer}
