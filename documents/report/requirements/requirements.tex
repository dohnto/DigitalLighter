In this chapter expected behavior of product and its resulting requirements will be described. 
First there will be introduced simple life cycle of the product.
Although project title was accepted as a domain and not a final product, following requirements could be applied also on project that is not scaled down.

\section{Description}
To clarify and properly explain life cycle of one run of server side application, its usage and possible requirements, structure of UML's activity diagram \cite{Dumas:2001:UAD:647245.719456} was adopted. 
Therefore we show in Figure \ref{fig:activity_diagram} interaction between manager and one client user.
Notice that there are some actions of both manager and client user which do require direct manipulation with mobile phone or other actors such as "Notice users to raise their mobiles", "Raise mobile", "Put down mobile" and more.

\section{Requirements} \label{txt:requirements}
Requirements can be divided into two categories \cite[p.~19]{ntnu_req}: functional and non-functional. 
Functional ones describe a function which a system or system component must be able to perform \cite[p.~35]{ieee610.12:1990}.
On the other hand non-functional requirements cover what product is, they are any other requirements than functional  \cite[p.~20]{ntnu_req}.


\subsection{Functional}
The use case diagram of whole system with all actors is shown in Figure \ref{img:usecase}
According to this use case diagram, list of functional requirements was created.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{End user} You can see list of those requirements from end user's point of view below.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[\textbf{E1}] \label{req_E1}
		I as a end user want to be able to read instructions.
	\item[\textbf{E2}] \label{req_E2}
		I as a end user want to be able to download relevant application from mobile application store.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Client user} You can see list of functional requirements from client user's point of view below.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[\textbf{C1}] \label{req_C1}
		I as a client user I want to easily choose to which server/concert stage I would like to connect.
	\item[\textbf{C2}] \label{req_C2}
		I as a client user I want to connect to chosen server.
	\item[\textbf{C3}] \label{req_C3}
		I as a client user I want to become a \emph{Pixel}.
	\item[\textbf{C4}] \label{req_C4}
		I as a client user I want to be able to pause being a Pixel.
	\item[\textbf{C5}] \label{req_C5}
		I as a client user I want to be able to disconnect from server/stage.
\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{Manager} You can see list of functional requirements from manager's point of view below.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[\textbf{M1}] \label{req_M1}
		I as a manager I want to be able to choose name for my server/stage.
	\item[\textbf{M2}] \label{req_M2}
		I as a manager I want to be able to create a server.
	\item[\textbf{M3}] \label{req_M3}
		I as a manager I want to be able view attendance.
	\item[\textbf{M4}] \label{req_M4}
		I as a manager I want to be able to start mobile phone localization.
	\item[\textbf{M5}] \label{req_M5}
		I as a manager I want to be able to choose playlist to be played.
	\item[\textbf{M6}] \label{req_M6}
		I as a manager I want to be able to start playing given media.
	\item[\textbf{M8}] \label{req_M7}
		I as a manager I want to be able to stop the media.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Non-functional}
Non-functional requirements are the overall factors that affect run-time behavior, system design, and user experience. Some of these attributes are related to the overall system design, while others are specific to run time, design time, or user centric issues. The list and description of non-functional requirements for DigitalLighter application is below, and also shown on Figure \ref{img:qualityAttributes}.

\paragraph{Accessibility}
is the degree to which the product is available to as many users as possible. 
Accessibility can be viewed as the "ability to access" and benefit from the product. 
To achieve accessibility team plan to fulfill following requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[\textbf{N1}] \label{req_N1} Product must be developed as two separate application, server and a client.
\item[\textbf{N2}] \label{req_N2} Client side application must work on Android platform.
\item[\textbf{N3}] \label{req_N3} Application must be deployed to Google Play application store.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Maintainability}
- the product needs to isolate defects or their cause, prevent unexpected breakdowns, correct defects and repair or replace faulty components. If one component need to be replaced, then the system should do this without having to replace still-working parts. The product also needs make future maintenance easy. 

\paragraph{Performance}
is about managing system resources in the face of particular types of demands to achieve acceptable system behavior. In particular performance objectives that have to be satisfied are:
\begin{itemize}
\item [\textbf{N4}] \label{req_N4}  Client must be able to play command colors at least 1 frame per second,
\item [\textbf{N5}] \label{req_N5} Client need to have minimal possible impact on device's battery, 
\item [\textbf{N6}] \label{req_N6} Server must be able to detect fake lights and cancel their influence on the system,
\item [\textbf{N7}] \label{req_N7} Server must be responsive and without User Interface freezing,
\item[\textbf{N8}] \label{req_N8} The product must support at least 16 client devices.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Modifiability}
- code must be prepared for changes, and this can only be done by increase cohesion, and reduce coupling. 
If the modules get built smaller, the risk of having to make a change will be reduced. 
Team should also make sure that dependencies are restricted. 
Increasing the cohesion, or interdependency within modules, can affect build time, load time, initialization time or run time, therefore some trade-offs have to be done. By all means system must satisfy following requirement:
\begin{itemize}
\item[\textbf{N9}] \label{req_N9} The product must be scalable -- it must work with  different count of client devices.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Interoperability}
describes the extent to which systems and devices can exchange data, and interpret that shared data. Digital Lighter server and client application should be able to mutually share specific structure or format of data that is preserved and unaltered during the process. For this purpose:
\begin{itemize}
\item[\textbf{N10}] \label{req_N10} The communication protocol should be established.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Usability} - DigitalLighter have to be easy to use, understandable, and easy to learn. This can be achieved with good User Interface and logical sequence of actions in order to achieve desired behavior. Therefore team should use only native widgets that all Android users are familiar with, making multiple Activities\footnote{\url{http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html}} composed of functionally related options, and providing only functionality given by requirements so visual noise can be reduced.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter it was explained how the application's basic life-cycle looks like and the use case diagram in Figure \ref{img:usecase} was introduced.
According to use case diagram there were created \emph{Epics} which serve as a requirements. 
After that non-functional requirements were introduced following by quality attributes that Digital Lighter have to satisfy.
These are summarized in Figure \ref{img:qualityAttributes}.
In following chapters each user story which is connected to relevant requirement will be referenced with requirement's identification.

As you could see, client user's interaction with both applications is rather simple (and as the customer suggested the user interface is not core of the work) the main attention will be focused on image processing, network programming, synchronization and mapping devices into screen.

User stories will be chosen by customer after discussion with team during each planning meeting.
Its priorities can be change anytime since the team is trying to be as agile as possible.
During the planning meeting, if needed, new stories can be created or some stories can be discarded.
