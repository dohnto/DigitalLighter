\subsection {Terminology}
\label{sec:terminology}
After a few meetings with the supervisor and customer, it was settled that terminology must be presented in report to prevent misunderstandings since both customer and supervisor use different terminology.
Below there is listed product related terminology that will be used in further chapters of this report.

\paragraph{Client user}
is a participant of the concert who wants to actively take part in show and he can download client application.

\paragraph{Server user}
or simply \textbf{Manager} is a person who controls what media should be played on screen made from mobile phone's of users. 
He can also manage other general settings.

\paragraph{End user} is either manager or end client user.

\paragraph{DigitalLighter}
is the final product. It is containing of two separate applications \emph{client} and \emph{server}.

\paragraph{Client} or \textbf{Client side} is an application controlled by client user and provides him an opportunity to be part of the screen by displaying figures on his mobile.

\paragraph{Server} or \textbf{Server side} is and application controlled by manager and provides him opportunity to change the media displayed on screen.

\paragraph{Pixel} is a client user's mobile phone under control of the manager.

\section{Project purpose and concept}
The audience members at a rock concert should be able to download a simple application to their smart phone, and register this through a simple GUI.
Behind the artist on stage there is a screen, with a simple camera on top. 
The camera is taking pictures of the audience. 
At special occasions the audience will be instructed, by the artist, to hold up their phones with the screen towards the stage. 
The mobile is a replacement for the lighter.  

On control a signal the application will fill the entire mobile screen with a single color.
The control signal can as an example say: all pixels white.
The signal will be specific for each application.
Each mobile's screen will be a pixel in a larger picture, which will be presented on the big screen. 
What kind of picture the audience can create will depend on the number of people in the audience. 

As a motivation for the audience to hold up their phone, the camera on top of the screen will take pictures of the audience.
In that way the audience can see a reflection of themselves, and see what kind of picture they are creating together.
\newpage
\section{Project name}
The customer wants a product to make the audience as a screen on a rock concert. 
The team has decided to name the product \emph{Digital Lighter}. 
This name was settled because this product digitalizes the concept from "the old days", where the crowd at a concert held up lighters, to create a special atmosphere.

\section{Goals}
Goals are statements that describe what the project will accomplish. 
The very first step in all projects is to define goals. 
It is important to spend sufficient time on this step, or else it can lead to unsuccessful project completion in many different ways. 
   
\label{sec:project-goals}

\subsection{Project goals}

\paragraph{Finish the project within the scheduled timetable}
One of the goals is to finish the project within the given time frame. 
In this particular case it means to deliver both product and report until 21th of November, when the final presentation take place.

\paragraph{Finish the project within the specified requirements}
Another goal is to make sure customer's needs are met.
This could be done simply by finishing the project with the specifics the customer really wanted. 
The best way to solidify this is to verify accomplishment by customer hand off and close down.

\subsection{Group goals}
\paragraph{Receive a good grade}
Getting a good grade is important because it says something about what you have learned in this course. 
This is relevant in terms of what job we might get when we have graduated. It also shows an employer that we can work hard. 
\paragraph{Receive a good recommendation from customer/supervisor}
If we work really hard, and impress the supervisor and the customer it would be nice to get a recommendation. This would be a bonus for our CV.

\subsection{Personal goals}
\paragraph{Agnethe}

My personal goal is to learn about group dynamics and collaboration. Another goal is to learn more about writing reports, because it is important to get some experience before writing the for the masters degree. One of my goals is to deliver a product the customer is pleased with. It is also a great chance that I might work as an IT-consultant, and I want to learn as much as possible about this profession. I also want get better at holding presentations, because there will always be another presentation to hold. My last goal is to learn as much as possible about android and mobile development.

\paragraph{Jan}

This class was suggested to me by a few students who have already passed it. As from what I have learned it should be challenging and the students should receive a lot of experience while working on a project. From this point of view my personal goal is to improve my soft-skills regarding team collaboration as well as the technical skills, mostly the Java/Android programming. While I study at the Computer graphics department on my home university the image processing part of this project is also of the great value for me. I also expect to get the proper feedback from both the supervisor and the customer so I could learn from the mistakes or wrong approaches.

\paragraph{Milos}

I had the opportunity to work on actual projects before, but never as a part of a team. 
My primary goal is to determine how to cooperate and work with others in achieving mutual goals.
I want to learn about agile software development in practice.
To find out how to separate tasks, how to manage an ongoing project, and how to be a valuable part of the team.
I didn't expect to gain any technical knowledge of this course, but after discovering the project assignment I definitely want to learn about image processing.
I expected multicultural team and that report has to be written in English.
Therefore I wanted to profound my knowledge of English Language.

\paragraph{Tomas}
I have chosen NTNU university for my exchange studies because of this class. 
I was expecting to improve my soft-skills, software engineering knowledge and also my written and spoken English and to be treated like in real project.
As this class has already started, I can add to my personal goals also learning Java programming language,
Android platform development and improving my skills concerning image processing.

\section{Stakeholders}

The stakeholders in this project is any person or organization, which has some interest or is affected by this project. Together they construct the different restrictions and goals for the project. 
You can see the organization chart in Figure \ref{img:organization_chart}.

\subsection{Customer}
Peder Kongelf is our customer. He works as an consultant for Netlight AS is, which a consulting company with field of expertise is within IT management, IT governance, IT-strategy, IT-organization and IT-research. He has experience with working as a consultant, working in scrum,  and with mobile development. Therefor he is able to provide the team guidence and support with various issues during the project. Even though he is the customer, he really wants us to learn from this experience, so he gives a lot of good advice.      

\subsection{Development team}
The development team's role is, first of all, to meet all requirements presented by the customer and IDI. 
The team is responsible for development of the project and is also responsible for writing all the documentation for this course.  

\subsection{Supervisor}

Anh Nguyen Duc is the supervisor assigned to this project from The Department of Computer and Information Science. 
The main responsibility of the team's supervisor is to overview the whole project and discuss the work done together with the future plans. 

Of course the interest from the university in general is to provide some real experience to the students, and prepare them for the business world.

\subsection{End users}
End user is an everyday person who uses the end product. The plan is to release the product on the application store for Android. That way the feedback could be received from someone other than supervisor and customer. 

\subsection{Stakeholder summary}
You can see a list of stakeholders with their email contacts in Table \ref{tab:stakeholders_summary}.
